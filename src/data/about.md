I am Portuguese ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹, was born in Switzerland ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­, and currently live in London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§.

I'm the author behind the viral [Gamestonk Terminal](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal). Yup, [mum I'm famous](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjp9vp/gamestonk-terminal-is-a-diy-meme-stock-version-of-bloomberg-terminal).

I started Gamestonk Terminal during Covid break on my own, and am now leading a team of 20 building the future of investment research. Read my story [here](https://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did).

The few hours I'm not working on OpenBB I play football, read-write-code (rwx), invest, travel and play Switch.
