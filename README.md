# Personal Website

The basis of this website was taken from [mldangelo.com](https://mldangelo.com). Michael D'Angelo has open source his personal website which you can fork from [here](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) - I have started a new repo since I intend to diverge quite a bit from the original.

Thanks [Jose Donato](https://github.com/jose-donato) for helping me with everything I know about web development.

Run using: `npm start`

WORK IN PROGRESS
